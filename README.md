### Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹
I'm primarily a back-end developer, working with PHP and (recently) Java. I also like to tinker with networking, infrastructure and IoT projects.

I have experience in PHP, MySQL, Microsoft SQL, WordPress, Git, Subversion, Docker, Windows (IIS) & Linux (NGINX) Application Infrastructure management.

I have dabbled in Java, Python, JavaScript (NodeJS, React), CSS, Inkscape (Vectors), Flash Professional (ActionScript), HomeAssistant, and more.
