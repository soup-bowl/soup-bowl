Hi, I'm Casey (he/them) - a **Developer** with a passion for coding, networking, cloud infrastructure (Azure), and IoT (Raspberry Pi).

<!--
A word on how I determine the difference between 'experienced' and 'dabbled'.
My personal conditions of considering myself experienced follow this ruleset:

* Have I used this for more than 3 years?
* Am I able to recall some basic principles/functions without needing to Google?
* Can I spot good and bad practices in this technology? Do I know appropriate use-case scenarios?
* Have I used, or is my code in Production somewhere in the universe?

Professional qualifications in areas will leapfrog the above requirements.

üöÄ I have experience in PHP, MySQL, C#, Microsoft SQL, WordPress, Git, Subversion, Docker, Windows (IIS) & Linux (NGINX) Application Infrastructure management.

üñ•Ô∏è I have dabbled in Java, Python, JavaScript (NodeJS, React), CSS, Inkscape (Vectors), Flash Professional (ActionScript), HomeAssistant, and more.
